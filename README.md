Meteorology Chemistry Interface Processor (http://www.cmaq-model.org)

MCIP is an open-source development project of the U.S. EPA Atmospheric Science Modeling Division for converting Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model meteorlogy data for input to the CMAQ air quality model and SMOKE emissions processor. MCIP is supported and distributed by the CMAS Center (http://www.cmascenter.org).

The MCIP Git archive is organized with each official public release stored as a branch on the main CMASCenter/MCIP repository. To check out code from the MCIP Git archive, specify the branch (i.e. version number) and issue the following command from within a working directory on your server:

git clone -b 4.3 https://github.com/CMASCenter/MCIP.git

This command shows how to check out MCIP v4.3 codes and scripts.

The release versions of CMAQ that are currently available on Git Hub include:

* v4.3 (November 2015)
* v4.2 (Dec 2013)
